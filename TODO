DONE:
Implemented a State class with all the helper functions.
Implemented a Graph class that is able to retrieve the neighboring tiles of any tile.

TO-DO:
Implement a node class that will be able to construct a tree for any particular state. With a pointer to its parent.
(The idea behind it is that we start traversing the tree up until)

Find a way to build the tree with all the nodes in it.
